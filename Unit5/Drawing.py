3) What does the following code output/draw?
bob = turtle.Turtle() 	# creates a turtle named bob
bob.shape("turtle")   	# Makes bob look like a turtle
for size in range(0, 100): # repeats n times.  What is n in this case?
  bob.forward(50)      	# Moves bob forward 50 units
  bob.right(95)         	# Turns bob 95 degrees
  bob.forward(50)      	# Moves bob forward 50 units
window.exitonclick()  	# Exits the window when clicked

The code above draws three lines in each iteration repeatedly. The drawing eventually becomes a flower-like shape with a circular center 
and triangle petals. However, if the user lets the turtle repeatedly draw the figure 100 times, the drwaing ends up as a cicle in the center
with intersecting lines as its border.
