# 2018-Summer-Python
This summer at ATDP Berkeley, I took the Introduction to Programming course where I learnt Python and the  basics of object-oriented programming. The course covered topics from simple datatypes to recursion and creating functions. For my final project, I created a game in an ice maze with a point system, monsters, fruits as tokens, and a character.
