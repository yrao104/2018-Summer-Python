# 2018-Summer-Python
Took "Introduction to Programming" course at ATDP Berkeley
<br />
I learnt Python and the  basics of object-oriented programming. The course covered topics from simple datatypes to recursion and creating functions.
<br />
For my final project, I created a game in an ice maze with a point system, monsters, fruits as tokens, and a character.
