prompt the user for two integer numbers (numbers without decimal points).
It will next display the following output:
• First line: the sum of the first and second number
• Second line: the result of subtracting the second number from the first
• Third line: the product of the first and the second number
• Fourth line: the integer division of the first number by the second number, followed by
the remainder from dividing the first number by the second number

difference = int(integer2) - int(integer1)
print("When you subtract " + integer1 + " from " + integer2 + ", you get " + str(difference) + ".")
product = int(integer1) * int(integer2)
